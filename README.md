# Emotion-Classification-Publication
This research publication presents a real-time emotion detection methodology using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We address issues with existing datasets and utilize the FER2013 collection, including non-actor images. Our preprocessing steps and custom model construction enhance performance. However, the final model achieves around 62% accuracy. Quantitative analysis shows proficiency in detecting happy and surprise emotions, with limitations in recognizing categories like disgust. The paper focuses on developing a real-time emotion detection system, with potential applications in healthcare, social media, and education. We explore the challenges of using acted emotions datasets and highlight the importance of detecting genuine emotions. The research aims to provide valuable insights into emotional disorders, aiding researchers and mental health professionals in developing effective treatment strategies. The model employs Convolutional Neural Networks to classify facial expressions into seven core emotions based on Darwin et al.'s work [1998].
